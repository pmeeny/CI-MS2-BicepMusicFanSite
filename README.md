# UX
## Strategy
### Primary Goal
- The primary goal of the website from the site owners perspective is to showcase the duo's music on spotify, let fans know about upcoming events, let fans learn more about the djs duo and to subscribe to their mailing list 
- The primary goal of the website from a site users perspective is to view and listen to the duo's music on spotify, learn about upcoming events, learn more about the djs duo and to subscribe to their mailing list 
## Structure
I have structured the website into four pages, each with clear, concise structure, information and purpose. I use the Bootstrap grid system throughout, which gave a consistent structure and responsive design "out of the box"

1. Index: The index(homepage): This is the first page the user encounters, it contains
2. About: The about page reads information from Spotify and displays the bands 2 albums with album information, track listing(with links), the dj's top tracks and the ability to listen to these top tracks on the page in a media player
3. Events: The events page reads information from ticketmaster on all of biceps events with date, time, title, ticket information and a link to the google map of where the event will be
4. Quiz: The quiz page asks 10 questions on the dj duo, with a timer, and displays the top score for the user for the browser session

## Surface
### Color Palette
There are TBC colours in the color palette with a 
- Primary colour of 
- Secondary colour of 

![Responsive site example](/assets/images/color_palette.png)

- I feel the primary and secondary colours complement each other very well, and I choose those colours after testing a number of palettes while making sure the colour palette met accessibility standards.

### Typography
The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the Roboto font cannot be imported into the website correctly.
This font is from the Google fonts library

## Test Results

### Feature 1 



<br>

## Bugs found during the testing phase

Bug Number | Comment |  Solution/Design decision |
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | 
1 | The time spent is displaying after each question, not in total | The fix was to create a new div called total_time_spent, and to update this div as part of the method displayQuestions() instead of checkAnswer()
2 | The allAnswers element was being overwritten if 2 questions had the same number | The fix was to create a new counter, and to increment that separately when adding to the allAnswers list
3 | The top score was not displaying the current value, once a quiz has been completed | The fix was to call getTopScore after setTopScore once 10 questions were complete
4 | The top score is not displayed after 1st attempt results page | The fix was to  $("#top_score").show() to show the div
5 | After the mailing list mailing list modal closes the screen remains dark and the index isn't loading properly. |The fix was to add $("#mailingListModal").modal("hide"); when submit button is clicked

# Deployment
The website was developed using the Visual Studio Code IDE due to the extensibility of the Visual Studio Code IDE and I plan on using this IDE for future projects. 

The source code is stored in GIT in the repo: pmeeny/CodeInstitute-MilestoneProject2-BicepMusicFanSite(master branch) 

The website was deployed on GitHub pages (https://pages.github.com/) using the following steps

2. Click the Repositories tab and select the repository pmeeny/CodeInstitute-MilestoneProject2-BicepMusicFanSite
3. In the menu, select Settings
4. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section
5. Under source, select the master branch and save
6. The website is now deployed, and the link is displayed in the GitHub Pages section

To run this project locally, you will need to clone the repository
1. Login to GitHub (https://wwww.github.com)
2. Select the repository pmeeny/CodeInstitute-MilestoneProject2-BicepMusicFanSite
3. Click the Code button and copy the HTTPS url, for example: https://github.com/pmeeny/CodeInstitute-MilestoneProject2-BicepMusicFanSite.git
4. In your IDE, open a terminal and run the git clone command, for example 

```git clone https://github.com/pmeeny/CodeInstitute-MilestoneProject2-BicepMusicFanSite.git```

5. The repository will now be cloned in your workspace
